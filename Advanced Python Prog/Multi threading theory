collection of instruction -program
collection of programe-software
single task-single thread (smallest unit that can be executed)
default thread which is mandatory-main thread
collection of functions and classes-module


MULTITHREADING:way to acheive multtasking 
-process based multitasking-executing multiple task where each task is independent
-thread based multitasking-same prog containing several task.each thread is seprate independent part and all task executing simultaneously

Application of multithreading:
-videogame development
-animation
-multimedia graphics
-development of web and server

When should we go for multithreading:
if all the task are independent,then there is no need to execute each task independently

Ways to create threadin python:
-BESTWAY-thread creation by extending thread class
-thread creation w/o using any class
-thread creation  w/o extending any class

when you call start() method ,run() method automatically gets executed and performs our job

thread identification number -Ident
every thread yani task internally having UID number and that can be get by implicit variable ident 

difference between suspend(),sleep() and wait():
-sleep():sleep method send the current Thread into non runnable state for a given amount of time .And sleep() belongs to thread class
-wait():wait method send thread into non runnable state until called notify or notifyAll for this object .And wait() belongs to obj class
-suspend():suspend method suspends the thread till resume method is called on that thread suspend methodis disapproved as it is prone to deadlock situtation


Types of thread:
-deamon 
-non deamon thread

DEAMON THREAD:thread that runs in the background and it provides support to non deamon i.r main thread

Synchronization:
when man thread runs low on memory,immediately PVM runs garbage collector to destory useless objects and to provide free memory,so that main thread continues its execution without any memory issues

PVM python virtual machine is Python interpreter

Application of python : online railway resgistration

Implementation of synchronization in python:
-lock
-semaphore
-Rlock

-Lock concept of synchronization:
threading modeule provide the lock concept and create lock obj 
 ex. obj=Lock()
if one thread tries to access the same obj lock that other thread is already holding then 1st thread need to wait unlit the other thread releases it.
The acquire()method help the thread to acquire the lock and by using release()method thread release the lock
