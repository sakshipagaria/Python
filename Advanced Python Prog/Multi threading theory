MULTITHREADING:way to acheive multtasking 
-process based multitasking-executing multiple task where each task is independent
-thread based multitasking-same prog containing several task.each thread is seprate independent part and all task executing simultaneously

Application of multithreading:
-videogame development
-animation
-multimedia graphics
-development of web and server

When should we go for multithreading:
if all the task are independent,then there is no need to execute each task independently

Ways to create threadin python:
-BESTWAY-thread creation by extending thread class
-thread creation w/o using any class
-thread creation  w/o extending any class
